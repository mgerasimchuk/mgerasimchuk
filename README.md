### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Mikhail

I'm a creator of architectural solutions based on the principles of high availability, observability, scalability, and fast delivery using Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, and GitLab, as well as on the principles of the [clean architecture practices](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) at the business applications level written in Golang.

I'm also a side project enthusiast, and for the past few years, I've been working on my own [teamcoding.ru](https://teamcoding.ru).
